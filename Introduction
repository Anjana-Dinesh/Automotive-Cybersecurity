What is Automotive Cybersecurity and why do we need it?
Automobiles can easily be called 'Computers on Wheels' given the fact that it contains multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs) which function based on software that is coded into it. No longer are vehicles just simple mechanical devices that take us from one point to another. Most if not all the activities that we perform on a computer or mobile can be performed on a vehicle. We can listen to music using the infotainment system, navigate our way through using the GPS system, check the vehicle health using different monitoring systems present on the vehicle, etc.
